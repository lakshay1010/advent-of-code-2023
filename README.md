# Advent of Code 2023

**Primary lang**  Python  
**Secondary langs** Ruby, C++

## Goals
- Get all stars
- Try to implement solutions in all secondary langs as well
- Optimise the process
- Optimise solutions
- Learn the idiom 
- Explore novel solutions



**Q. Why seperate folders for the two problems per day?**  
Because I want to try different solutions for the problems and also benchmark different solutions.
I ack tht a lot can be optimised, will try that ltr.



## Stats

I wrote `stats.py` to benchmark the solutions.

> TODO: benchmark memory usage as well
